/// An inode is a structure on the disk that represents a file, directory,

/// etc. that they represent. Instead, they link to the blocks that actually
/// contain the data. This lets the inodes themselves have a well-defined size
/// which lets them be placed in easily indexed arrays. Each block group has an
/// array of inodes it is responsible for, and conversely every inode within a
/// file system belongs to one of such tables (and one of such block groups).
